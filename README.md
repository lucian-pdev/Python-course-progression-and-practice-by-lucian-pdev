Greetings!

The files in this repo are meant to showcase my progression in learning and mastering the python programming language.
This repository is intended for non-commercial purposes, it, along with the rest of my public github content, is a display of my skill level for future collaborations and employment offers.

Thank you for offering me the chance to create programs!
