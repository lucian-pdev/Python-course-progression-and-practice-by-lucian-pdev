# Your task is to write a program which:

#     asks the user for Prof. Jekyll's file name;
#     reads the file contents and counts the sum of the received points for each student;
#     prints a simple (but sorted) report, just like this one:
# Andrew   Cox      1.5
# Anna     Boleyn   15.5
# John     Smith    7.0 

# Note:

#     your program must be fully protected against all possible failures: 
# the file's non-existence, the file's emptiness, or any input data failures; 
# encountering any data error should cause immediate program termination, 
# and the error should be presented to the user;
#     implement and use your own exceptions hierarchy â€“ we've presented it in the editor; 
# the second exception should be raised when a wrong line is detected, 
# and the third when the source file exists but is empty.

# Tip: Use a dictionary to store the students' data.
